"""
The following skeletonization algorithm implementation would not have been possible without code from Christoph Kirst/TubeMap 2.0.

Kirst's implementation of the Palagyi 1999 skeletonization algorithm uses an ingenenious technique to examine local volume point topology. In essence, a LUT table of the 2**26 possible 3x3x3 cubes is created, matched with the Palagyi templates, and used as a reference to determine the removal status of border points.

Kirst creates the tables using right-shifted ints & 0x01 in range(2**26) to create the candidate cubes, and then uses a rotated base cube summed with local 3x3x3 topology to determine whether the point should be removed. Awesome programming.

Unfortunately, this algorithm produces skeletons that are not as well-structured as the Lee '94 algorithm, so it wasn't used for the program. However, it has been left for potential future implementations.
