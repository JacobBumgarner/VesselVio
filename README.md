VesselVio is an open-source application designed for the analysis and visualization of segmented vasculature datasets. 

There are several ways to use VesselVio:

- [Download the app](https://jacobbumgarner.github.io/VesselVio/Downloads.html) for Windows and MacOS.
- Run the app from your terminal by using the VesselVio.py file (single-line executable)
  - Follow the Windows & MacOS build instructions [here](https://jacobbumgarner.github.io/VesselVio/Build.html)
- Modify the analysis pipeline and add custom analyses using the VVTerminal.py file

VesselVio is compatible with several different types of segmented vasculature datasets, including:
- Segmented vascular volumes from any imaging source (e.g., LSFM, ÂµCT)
- Annotated volumes, including:
  - Whole-brain vasculature datasets with Allen Brain Institute ID-based annotations
  - Manually labelled datasets with a program such as [ITK-Snap](http://www.itksnap.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php)
  - RGB-based annotations, such as those created with [QuickNII](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/quicknii)
- Pre-constructed graphs (both edge- and vertex- based graphs)
- 2D and 3D datasets
- Isotropic and Anisotropic datasets


## Analysis
VesselVio reconstructs vascular networks to extract whole-network and individual segment features. Several examples of feature outputs can be seen below.

## Visualization
Visualization with VesselVio is made possible with [PyVista](https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista), an intuitive and high-level VTK package. Thanks to PyVista, users can easily visualize and examine their vasculature datasets with numerous options to create for accompanying figure images.
