Please feel free to [email me](mailto:vesselvio@gmail.com) or [create an issue](https://github.com/JacobBumgarner/VesselVio/issues) on GitHub if you run into other issues.

# NOTICE

- If using Windows, make sure to unzip the package before running. If the shortcut isn't working, you can create a new shortcut by going to VesselVio>Contents>VesselVio.exe. Please [contact us](mailto:vesselvio@gmail.com) with any questions or issues.

- The software packages are unsigned at the moment. This means that depending on your system settings, you'll likely have to approve the application for run. We will work to sign the application with authentication certificates in the near future.

If you'd rather run the application/single analyses from your IDE, you can find our source-code on [GitHub](https://github.com/JacobBumgarner/VesselVio). If you need help with python environment setup, follow our [build instructions](https://jacobbumgarner.github.io/VesselVio/Build.html).

Please feel free to [contact us](mailto:vesselvio@gmail.com) with any bug reports, download issues, or feature requests.
