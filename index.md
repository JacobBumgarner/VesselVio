## Vasculature Dataset Analysis and Visualization
VesselVio is an open-source application designed to allow researchers to analyze and visualize segmented vasculature datasets. The application is also compatible with annotated datasets and pre-constructed graphs made in other programs.

## Using VesselVio
To tackle large learning-curves imposed by traditional terminal-based analysis software, we built an open-source and standalone application that can be downloaded on [Windows and MacOS](https://jacobbumgarner.github.io/VesselVio/Downloads.html). The application interface allows for users to easily load datasets for analysis and visualization with custom parameters. 

Alternatively, you can also run the application from your terminal with a single line of code after following our step-by-step [installation and build instructions](https://jacobbumgarner.github.io/VesselVio/Build.html).

## Instructions 
Tutorials on how to use VesselVio to analyze your vasculature datasets can be found on the [Tutorial Page (Coming soon!)](https://jacobbumgarner.github.io/VesselVio/Instructions.html). It's important to remember that the application was built for the analysis of <i>segmented</i> vasculature datasets. If you're looking for resources to segment your datasets, you can check out [ClearMap](https://christophkirst.github.io/ClearMap2Documentation/html/home.html), [VesSAP](https://github.com/vessap/vessap), or [DeepVesselNet](https://github.com/giesekow/deepvesselnet). Of course, there are many more options available. 

If you're looking for help with annotating your whole-brain vasculature datasets, we'd recommend that you check out [QuickNII](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/quicknii/) as a starting point. 

## Download
Currently, VesselVio is available for download as a standalone application for computers running MacOS 11.6+ and Windows 10. 

This application is entirely open-source and free to download under the [GNU GPLv3 license](https://github.com/JacobBumgarner/VesselVio/blob/main/LICENSE). Reseachers hoping to modify or use individual components of the pipelines can find the source code on the [GitHub VesselVio page](https://github.com/JacobBumgarner/VesselVio).

Of course, if you use VesselVio in your research, don't forget to cite our publication in <i>[Cell Reports Methods](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-methods/fulltext/S2667-2375(22)00044-3)</i>.
