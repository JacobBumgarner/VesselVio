## Using VesselVio
VesselVio can be downloaded on [Windows and MacOS](https://jacobbumgarner.github.io/VesselVio/Downloads.html), or it can be run from a terminal with a single line of code after following our step-by-step [installation and build instructions](https://jacobbumgarner.github.io/VesselVio/Build.html). 

To analyze or visualize your binarized vasculature or graph datasets, simply load them into the application, define your analysis settings, and click 'Analyze' or 'Visualize'.

## External Resources 
It's important to remember that the application was built for the analysis of <i>segmented</i> vasculature datasets. If you're looking for resources to segment your datasets, you can check out [ClearMap](https://christophkirst.github.io/ClearMap2Documentation/html/home.html), [VesSAP](https://github.com/vessap/vessap), or [DeepVesselNet](https://github.com/giesekow/deepvesselnet). Of course, there are many more options available. 

If you're looking for help with annotating your whole-brain vasculature datasets, we'd recommend that you check out [QuickNII](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/quicknii/) as a starting point.
